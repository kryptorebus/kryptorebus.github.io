    <h1>🧩 Krypto Rebus</h1>
    <h2>Quick Guide to Solving the Rebus Puzzle</h2>

    <h2>🎯 Game Objective</h2>
    <p>Solve the jackpot rebus by sending the correct amount of ETH (in wei) that matches a hidden pattern. Each attempt can result in:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>🏆 Winning the entire contract balance</li>
        <li>💸 An immediate refund of your deposit — either fixed or randomized between 70% to 110%</li>
        <li>🎁 A clue in the form of a unique NFT — providing a system hint or a more or less clear lead toward the solution</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🔁 How to Play</h2>
    <p>Send ETH to the contract address (via your wallet or a web interface).</p>

    <h2>🧠 Game Mechanics</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>🧩 Clues:</strong> Hidden hints are represented by NFTs that lead toward the jackpot solution. Each correct amount sent may yield a clue.</li>
        <li><strong>💰 Jackpot:</strong> Discover the winning deposit amount — and you win the full contract balance.</li>
        <li><strong>🔁 Refunds:</strong> Depending on game settings, you may get your deposit refunded in part, in full, or even with a bonus.</li>
        <li><strong>🎨 NFTs:</strong> Each valid interaction results in minting a custom NFT that may be: a clue, a reward, or a thank-you for participating.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📜 Rules</h2>
    <p>Full game rules are available in the project description.</p>

    <h2>🛠 Technical Details</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>🔐 The smart contract is fully on-chain.</li>
        <li>💸 Collected fees help grow the jackpot and support project operation.</li>
        <li>💾 Winning logic is hash-protected and not publicly visible.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🧪 Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Every clue leads to another.</li>
        <li>Clues can be reused and strategically combined to speed up solving.</li>
        <li>Not winning? It’s likely because:
            <ul>
                <li>The correct amount hasn’t been discovered yet</li>
                <li>Or the contract balance isn’t high enough</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📍 Example</h2>
    <pre>
1. Player A sends 0.005 ETH → receives a clue on how to proceed.
2. Player B sends 0.003 ETH → too small to participate meaningfully.
3. Player A sends 0.007642 ETH → based on the clue, he discovers the solution and wins the jackpot!
    </pre>

    <h2>🧷 What Do I Need?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>An Ethereum wallet (e.g. MetaMask)</li>
        <li>Some ETH to play</li>
        <li>Curiosity, patience, and a sharp mind 🎲</li>
    </ul>
